Multi-Object Search (MOS) Task
==============================

This task is based on the Multi-Object Search (MOS) task described in the
following paper

`Multi-Object Search using Object-Oriented POMDPs <https://h2r.cs.brown.edu/wp-content/uploads/wandzel19.pdf>`_ (ICRA 2019)

In this implementation, we consider a different (simpler) motion action scheme,
instead of based on topological graph and room connectivity.

Refer to :doc:`examples.mos` for more details.
