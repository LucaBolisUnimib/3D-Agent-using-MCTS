# Defines the belief representation.

# Origin: Belief space planning assuming maximum likelihood observations

# Quote from the paper:

#     Belief state was modeled as an isotropic Gaussian pdf
#     over the state space: :math:`b = (m,s) \in \mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{R}^{+}`.

# Technical definition:

# * An **isotropic gaussian** is one where the covariance matrix is
#   represented by the simplified matrix `source <https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1991961/gaussian-distribution-is-isotropic>`_

# This is an example where you implement a problem-specific
# belief representation, instead of directly using an existing
# one provided by the pomdp_py; The interfaces of pomdp_py does
# support this kind of extension. In this example, the belief
# distribution is a variant of pomdp_py.Gaussian.

# The pomdp_py library does not (currently) include a BeliefState interface,
# since the belief distribution itself is just a Distribution and adding
# such interface makes the library unnecessarily complicated. The existing
# interfaces are fully able to support belief space planning as well.
