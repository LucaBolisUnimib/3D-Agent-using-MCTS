Either, an algorithm such as POMCP is used which will update
the belief automatically when the planner gets updated; Or,
a standalone particle belief distribution is updated. In
the latter case, the belief update algorithm is as described
in :cite:`silver2010monte` but written explicitly instead
of done implicitly when the MCTS tree truncates as in POMCP.
