Examples
========

In this document, we discuss some examples of using `pomdp_py` to define POMDP problems and solve them using :doc:`existing_solvers`. We will go over two examples: the simpler Tiger problem, and the more complicated but interesting Multi-Object Search (MOS) problem. The former represents how one could quickly implement a simple POMDP, and the latter represents how one may structure their project (as a convention) when using `pomdp_py` for more complicated domains.
