% Active visual object search in unknown environments using uncertain semantics. This paper has extraordinary literature review on the problem of object search. Their approach is based on semantic prior knowledge, but also includes a POMDP approach.

% This is also a POMDP. But they are not solving object search, but solving a problem of observing a scene; Also they choose a sequence of views to observe a single object. They RESTRICT the motion of the sensor to a sphere! Their observation model is the result of object detection method called VP-Tree

% This is Yuchen Xiao's ICRA 19 paper. Before getting into the differences, they mention in the related work that previous work ``reduce'' the target search problem to an active visual search problem. What does it mean by ``reduce''? Is active visual search easier at all?
% According to this page http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~tsotsos/Active_Vision/Active_Visual_Search.html,
% Our work doesn't consider grasping objects. All they did is to parameterized the action space by belief. This is not helpful for large problems in our case. Their motivation is that: ``However, running a rollout policy is a time-consuming operation, and the variance of the rollout estimator is also high due to the stochasticity of the environment, which we want to avoid.'' BUT, we simply used random rollout and it was fine. Also, we don't make assumptions about the search region that the target objects are aggregated in one location and the robot just have 2 viewpoints to look at the scene.

% The following two papers are about showing object search is a NP-Complete problem; The first one proves its NP-completeness, and the second one proposes a heuristic method which is about reducing possible sensor actions to consider. Their method is ``one-step look ahead'', while POMDP can do more than that. So POMDP is probably better suited.
%
% Quote from their paper:
% | "Since the calculation of the detection probability for a given operation is time consuming,
% | it is not practical to use complex strategies."
% So that's their bottleneck! That's not an issue for our direct concern.
%
% Another difference is that they consider the field of view to be changeable, thus making the action space very large, but we don't. The robot doesn't actively change its field of view size; But it just moves around. This is probably the approximation we are doing for our paper.

% This paper actually has both active sensor and manipulation. They mounted a camera on the end-effector. But the problem is that they used a guided shaped reward function, instead of the sparse reward as in our case. It's a very specifically designed reward that balances exploration vs. exploitation. In our case, this is taken care of by PO-UCT planning.

%Searching for Physical Objects in Partially Known Environments. I have pointed out their issues: 2D search space with boxes. Interestingly, they say, quote:
% | "In our domain, observations are drawn from
% | a continuous space of object poses, so making this search
% | tractable requires the construction of abstract observation
% | models, which reduce the effective branching factor and
% | number of state samples needed to represent beliefs."
% They mentioned ``abstract observation models''. Actually their way of describing ``target-based observation model'' resembles our observation model. However, clearly they don't consider volumetric observaiton space. In addition, their observation model does not consider uncertainty, as handled by a POMDP observation model (this is probably a more crucial point).

%%%%%%%% NEXT BEST VIEW Literature %%%%%%%%
% This is a planning problem in computer vision.
% The problem of finding a view pose which provides information for a task is known as the Next-Best-View (NBV) problem and was introduced by Connolly [Con85]. In this work, the exploration and object recognition tasks are formulated as NBV problems and solved with a local  optimization algorithm. (ref. https://ipvs.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/mlr/papers/16-zielke-Dipl.pdf)
%
% The Connolly paper is ``The Determination of next best views.''
% Interestingly,
% | "This paper describes two algorithms which use partial octree models to determine the "best" next view to take."
% But octree in their context means object geometry information.
%
% In computer vision, they are more interested in object reconstruction.
% Check this reference http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/~olaf/nbv.html;
% Clearly, the next-best-view problem is:
% | "This paper reviews the development of algorithms which compute the best location for range scanning device relative to a real world object, in order to obtain the next in a series of automatic scans. "
% 
% There has been exploration paper in robotics, "Receding Horizon “Next–Best–View” Planner for 3D Exploration" which constructs a tree into the future and selects the first edge for execution. But this is not really a next-best view problem.
%
% NBV also used for scene reconstruction (naturally).
%
% This paper is just a different problem. Forget it. I think NBV literature doesn't really affect us. At most mention very briefly.
