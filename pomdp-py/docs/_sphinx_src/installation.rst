Installation
============

We recommend using `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_ and `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_ to manage package versions and installation.

Pre-installation
----------------

1. install Python 3.8+ from `official website <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.


Install pomdp-py
----------------

Install `pomdp-py` by::

    pip install pomdp-py

This should just work for Linux and MacOS. On Windows, you may need to first run :code:`pip install Cython` then run the above command.
See `this wiki page <https://github.com/h2r/pomdp-py/wiki/Installing-pomdp%E2%80%90py-on-Windows>`_ for installation instructions on Windows.

.. _install_dev:

| Or, **install as developer**

1. Install Cython::

    pip install Cython

2. Download `pomdp-py` latest release `on github <https://github.com/h2r/pomdp-py/releases>`_, or clone the repository by::

    git clone https://github.com/h2r/pomdp-py.git

3. Go to the package root directory (where :code:`setup.py` is located). Run::

    pip install -e .

   This will build and install `pomdp_py` package. This will build :code:`.so` files and copy them to the python source directory.  When you make changes to :code:`.pyx` or :code:`.pyd` files, run the following to rebuild those :code:`.so` libraries, so that the python imports can get those changes you made::

     make build

Test things out
---------------

1. Verify that **Tiger** works::

    python -m pomdp_py -r tiger

  You should see output like::

      ** Testing value iteration **
      ==== Step 1 ====
      True state: tiger-left
      Belief: [(State(tiger-right), 0.5), (State(tiger-left), 0.5)]
      Action: listen
      Reward: -1
      >> Observation: tiger-left
      ...


2. Optionally, verify that **RockSample**, and **Multi-Object Search** problems work. This requires installing additional dependencies::

     pip install pomdp-py[problems]
     python -m pomdp_py -r rocksample
     python -m pomdp_py -r mos


  For the **RockSample** problem, you should see something like::

      *** Testing POMCP ***
      ==== Step 1 ====
      Particle reinvigoration for 66 particles
      True state: State((0, 4) | ('bad', 'good', 'bad', 'good', 'good') | False)
      Action: sample
      Observation: None
      Reward: 0.0
      Reward (Cumulative): 0.0
      Reward (Cumulative Discounted): 0.0
      __num_sims__: 1217
      World:

      ______ID______
      .....>
      4....>
      ..210>
      .3...>
      R....>
      _____G/B_____
      .....>
      $....>
      ..x$x>
      .$...>
      R....>

  For **Multi-Object Search**, you should see a plot like below,

  .. image:: images/mos_window.png
     :alt: MOS window
     :scale: 75 %

  and the agent (a green circle) starts acting::

      $ python -m pomdp_py.problems.multi_object_search.problem
      pygame 1.9.6
      Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
      ==== Step 1 ====
      Action: move-xyth-North
      Observation: MosOOObservation({})
      Reward: -2
      Reward (Cumulative): -2
      Find Actions Count: 0
      __num_sims__: 542
      ==== Step 2 ====
      Action: look
      Observation: MosOOObservation({3: None, 8: None, 11: (0, 6), 12: None, 14: None})
      Reward: -1
      Reward (Cumulative): -3
      Find Actions Count: 0
      __num_sims__: 506
      ...

3. You can additionally run some tests (assuming you are at the root directory of the repository).
   Note that some tests
   requires installing external software (`pomdp-solve <https://www.pomdp.org/code/>`_
   and `sarsop <https://github.com/AdaCompNUS/sarsop>`_).

   .. code-block::

       python tests/test_all.py

   Expected output can be found `here <_static/expected_test_output.txt>`_.
